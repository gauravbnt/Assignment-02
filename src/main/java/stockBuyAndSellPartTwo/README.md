# üìà Stock Buy and Sell - Part Two

This Java program calculates the **maximum profit** you can achieve by performing **as many buy and sell transactions** as you like, given an array of stock prices over `n` days.

---

## ‚ùì Problem Description

You're given an array `prices[]` where `prices[i]` represents the price of a stock on day `i`. You can complete **multiple transactions** (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

> **Note:** You cannot engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The user enters the number of days and their respective stock prices.
2. The algorithm iterates through the array:

   * Whenever `prices[i] > prices[i-1]`, it **adds the profit** `prices[i] - prices[i-1]`.
3. Returns the **total maximum profit** from all upward price trends.
